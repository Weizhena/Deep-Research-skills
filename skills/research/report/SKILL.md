# Research Report - Summary Report

## Trigger
`/research-report`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate Results Directory
Find `*/outline.yaml` in current working directory, read topic and output_dir config.

### Step 2: Generate Python Conversion Script
Generate `generate_report.py` in `{topic}/` directory, script requirements:
- Read all JSON from output_dir
- Read fields.yaml to get field structure
- Cover all field values from each JSON
- Skip fields with values containing [uncertain]
- Skip fields listed in uncertain array
- Generate markdown report format: Table of contents (with anchor links) + Detailed content (by field category)
- Save to `{topic}/report.md`

#### Script Technical Requirements (Must Follow)

**1. JSON Structure Compatibility**
Support two JSON structures:
- Flat structure: Fields directly at top level `{"name": "xxx", "release_date": "xxx"}`
- Nested structure: Fields in category sub-dict `{"basic_info": {"name": "xxx"}, "technical_features": {...}}`

Field lookup order: Top level -> category mapping key -> Traverse all nested dicts

**2. Category Multi-language Mapping**
fields.yaml category names and JSON keys can be any combination (CN-CN, CN-EN, EN-CN, EN-EN). Must establish bidirectional mapping:
```python
CATEGORY_MAPPING = {
    "Basic Info": ["basic_info", "Basic Info"],
    "Technical Features": ["technical_features", "technical_characteristics", "Technical Features"],
    "Performance Metrics": ["performance_metrics", "performance", "Performance Metrics"],
    "Milestone Significance": ["milestone_significance", "milestones", "Milestone Significance"],
    "Business Info": ["business_info", "commercial_info", "Business Info"],
    "Competition & Ecosystem": ["competition_ecosystem", "competition", "Competition & Ecosystem"],
    "History": ["history", "History"],
    "Market Positioning": ["market_positioning", "market", "Market Positioning"],
}
```

**3. Complex Value Formatting**
- list of dicts (e.g., key_events, funding_history): Format each dict as one line, separate kv with ` | `
- Normal list: Short lists joined with comma, long lists displayed with line breaks
- Nested dict: Recursive formatting, display with semicolon or line breaks

**4. Extra Fields Collection**
Collect fields that exist in JSON but not defined in fields.yaml, put in "Other Info" category. Note to filter:
- Internal fields: `_source_file`, `uncertain`
- Nested structure top-level keys: `basic_info`, `technical_features` etc.

**5. Uncertain Value Skipping**
Skip conditions:
- Field value contains `[uncertain]` string
- Field name is in `uncertain` array
- Field value is None or empty string

### Step 3: Execute Script
Run `python {topic}/generate_report.py`

## Output
- `{topic}/generate_report.py` - Conversion script
- `{topic}/report.md` - Summary report
